# Sammich

Life changing mobile app that determines whether or not something is a sandwich

## How to run

This app was built with [Create React Native App (CRNA)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app.html) and requires an API key from [Clarifai](https://clarifai.com/developer/guide/) in order for the app to access their public [food model API](https://clarifai.com/models/food-image-recognition-model-bd367be194cf45149e75f01d59f77ba7)

To run locally put your Clarifai API KEY in the `.env` file then do

    npm install
    npm start

You can then download [Expo](https://expo.io/tools#client) on your android or iOS device, scan the QR code and view the app :)
